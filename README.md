# 🏀 NBA Data Analysis (2024-2025 Season)

This project explores the **2024-2025 NBA player stats**, uncovering insights into **individual performance trends** throughout the season. The analysis focuses on **offensive and defensive contributions**, highlighting key players using statistical metrics.

## 📂 Project Contents
- **`Ben Cox - NBA - Final.ipynb`** – Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and player evaluation.
- **`NBA Data Analysis.pptx`** – Presentation summarising key findings from the analysis.
- **`NBA Stats.csv`** – Raw dataset containing player statistics for the 2024-2025 season - ***All data accurate as of 05/03/2025*** .

## 🔍 Analysis Overview

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Before conducting any analysis, the dataset was cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involved:
- Handling missing & inconsistent data
- Standardising formats
- Ensuring data integrity

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key insights from the EDA:
- **Turnover rate:** A player had a **100% turnover rate**, meaning they lost possession every time they attempted to score.
- **Free throw attempts:** Most players take very few free throws, while a select few attempt over **500+**, indicating **elite scorers**.
- **Three-point shooting:** The majority of players have a **20-45% accuracy**, with outliers at **100% and near 0%** suggesting minimal attempts.

### 3️⃣ Offensive & Defensive Player Evaluation
- **Offensive players:**
  - **Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (OKC)** – Best in **true shooting % (0.644)**, **highest usage (34.5%)** and **top efficiency score**.
  - **Jayson Tatum (BOS)** – Balanced inside and outside scoring with nearly equal **two-point (582) and three-point (585) attempts**.
  - **Anthony Edwards & Cade Cunningham** – High-volume scorers with different shot distributions.

- **Defensive players:**
  - **Victor Wembanyama (SAS)** – **3.8 blocks per game**, dominating shot-blocker.
  - **Nikola Jokić (DEN)** – Highest steals per game (**1.8**), elite defensive rebounder.
  - **Anthony Davis (LAL)** – Strong **two-way** player with **1.3 steals & 2.1 blocks per game**.

### 4️⃣ Ranking the Best Players
A **weighted scoring system** was used to rank **top all-round NBA players** based on:
- **Offensive metrics (50%)**: True shooting %, usage %, three-point & two-point attempts, points per game
- **Defensive metrics (50%)**: Steals, blocks, rebounds, defensive rating

🏆 **Shai Gilgeous-Alexander** emerged as the most complete player this season.

## 📊 Tools Used
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **PowerPoint for presentation**
- **Data visualisation techniques**

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open **`NBA Stats.csv`** to view the raw dataset.
2. Open **`Ben Cox - NBA - Final.ipynb`** in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis.
4. Review key insights in **NBA Data Analysis.pptx**.

## 🏆 Key Takeaways
- **Statistical anomalies** can provide insights into player roles and team dynamics.
- **High-efficiency scorers** tend to have **higher usage rates**.
- **Defensive impact** varies greatly by position and playstyle.
